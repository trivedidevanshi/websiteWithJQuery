# Project 4: Launch Pads

Apartment marketplace app with city filtering, and rendering JSON data using AJAX.

- Used AJAX to fetch property listings from a remote server via a HTTP request.
- Used bootstrap list-group to dynamically create a list of the properties.
- Applied JQuery .not utility to hide the listings for other cities than the one clicked in the sidebar.
- Made an AJAX call on click of the listing and used .grep() utility to filter out the address of the clicked property.
- Created a Google Maps API String Query to open uo the property address on google maps in a new window.
